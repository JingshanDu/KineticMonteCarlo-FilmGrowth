# KineticMonteCarlo-FilmGrowth
A MATLAB program for simulating film growth using Kinetic Monte Carlo.


A simple Monte Carlo simulation of monolayer film growth written in Matlab (2010b tested)

Based on Metropolisâ€“Hastings, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

A 2-D potential field (Morse Potential) is assumed on the surface.

Might be kind of limited, because this is only part of a college coursework.
